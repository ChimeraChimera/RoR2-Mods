Spawn with a starting item of every tier. Any picked up items will be converted to the starting item of the same tier.

It's basically like a Shrine of Order that is applied at the very start of a run, and auto-converts any items picked up after the start.

It doesn't apply to no-tier items (like tonic affliction), nor does it apply to equipment items.
