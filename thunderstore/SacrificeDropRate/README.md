This mod will let you change the drop rate for the sacrifice artifact.

This mod only takes into account the percent entered in the config, meaning it will not take XP and monster value into account, unlike the default behavior. There is a ModEnabled toggle in the config that lets you enable/disable the mod if you wish to get the original artifact behavior without removing the mod.

Configuration
------------
The mod config file can be found under `BepInEx/config/com.ChevRoR.AlteredSacrificeArtifactRate.cfg`.

**ModEnabled (boolean) - Default: true** - Enables/disables the entire mod.

**SacrificeArtifactDropRate (float) Default: 5** - The percent chance that a monster will drop an item on death. Default is 5, which is a 5% chance.

Changelog
------------
1.0.0 - Initial mod
